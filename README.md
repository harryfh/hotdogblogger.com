A year ago, my friend made me buy the domain hotdogblogger.com and I forgot about it until now. I used it as a chance to learn [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a framework for developing static sites.

 I made a custom hotdog theme using tailwindcss. This was my first time using tailwind and I definitley see why people enjoy it.
